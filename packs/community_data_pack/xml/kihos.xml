    <Description>
Taught to the Tanuki Clan since their transportation to the colonies by 'Yogi Gurus', this kiho allows a Tanuki samurai to turn his most reliable companion, sake, into a most potent weapon. To activate this kiho, you must spend a Void Point and then drink some sake as Simple Action. For a number of rounds equal to your Stamina Rank, you are considered to be mechanically benefiting from the Breath of the Fire Dragon spell.
